  <span class="tag">[ul, li]</span>
  <p>The ul element represents a list of items, where the order of the items is not important â€” that is, where changing the order would not materially change the meaning of the list.</p>
  <p>The li element represents a list item. If its parent element is an ol, ul, or menu element, then the element is an item of the parent element's list, as defined for those elements. Otherwise, the list item has no defined list-related relationship to any other li element.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Art</li>
    <li>History</li>
    <li>Literature</li>
    <li>Sports</li>
    <li>Entertainment</li>
    <li>Science</li>
  </ul>

  <span class="tag">[ol]</span>
  <p>The ol element represents a list of items, where the items have been intentionally ordered, such that changing the order would change the meaning of the list.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>This is the first list item</li>
    <li>This is the second list item</li>
  </ol>
